# MyReads React App

 MyReads is a bookshelf app that allows users to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read. Users can also search for books and add books to their bookshelf. The project is build using React and data is provided and persisted by the [Udacity](https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com).

## Getting Started

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/romarioraffington/react-myreads.git
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

## Running Tests

```shell
$ yarn test
```

## Building the Project

```shell
$ yarn run build
```

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
